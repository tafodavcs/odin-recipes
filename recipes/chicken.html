        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This bang bang chicken is a wonderful Americanized version of an extremely popular Sichuan Chinese dish.
            <br>With twice-fried chicken, you get the crispy fried breading you'd expect, and the bang bang sauce drizzle makes the entire dish spectacular.</p>
        <p> You'll love this more than any restaurant version. Pay attention to the notes in the directions.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>¼ cup potato starch</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; stir to coat and allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and discard egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium bowl. Pour into a large plastic resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the bag and shake until chicken is well coated.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot oil for about 90 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each batch separate.</li>
            <li>Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Remove to another paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.</li>
            <li>Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a large serving bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
